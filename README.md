## 🗄️ Database Design

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing main tables and relations:

- **Users** – stores user details (first name, last name, email, password)
- **UserDetails** – stores extended profile details (bio, location, profile photo)
- **Skills** – list of skills
- **SkillsOffered** – mapping of users → skills they can teach
- **SkillsWanted** – mapping of users → skills they want to learn
- **Requests** – skill exchange requests between users
- **Chats** – created when a request is accepted
- **Messages** – messages exchanged in chats
- **Notifications** – alerts for requests and updates
